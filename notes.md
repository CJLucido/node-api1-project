- install 'express' -> 'npm i express'
-add index.js to root folder
-add server code inside 'index.js'
-run API using 'npm run server'
-test making a GET req to 'localhost:4000' (can use postman or insomnia- insomnia is better because I can work offline with it)

[client] send a req to a [server], the [server] then sends a response to the [client]

    the res object will be returned in JSON (because all browsers operate on that)

everything has been done on the root of the app
